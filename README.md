PS: All artificial datasets used to evaluate the performance of gene selection methods were deposited in the Zenodo repository [![DOI:10.5281/zenodo.6320499](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6320499.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6320499). The real datasets were collected from GEO and pre-processed according to the pipeline described in this manuscript.
